    "## Gotcha 2: `max_d` too high (or too low)\n",
    "\n",
    "When you compress the haplotype panels into a `.jlso` format, you specified `max_d` which is the maximum number of unique haplotypes per window. We generally recommend using `max_d = 1000`, BUT 1000 may be too small if you use a reference panel larger than HRC. In that case, you can try larger `max_d`, which will improve error rate. \n",

    "\n",
    "`Computing optimal haplotypes` is too slow. In particular, the timing for `haplopair search` is too high. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Symptoms for `max_d` too low:\n",
    "\n",
    "Too few typed SNPs per window indicates `max_d` is set too low. You can calculate the number of typed SNPs per window by dividing the total number of SNPs in the target file by the total windows (a number that will be output after every run). Ideally you want an average of 400 typed SNPs per window, but something as low as 50 still works. Something like 10~20 is too low. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### I really want to use a high `max_d`\n",
    "\n",
    "A high `max_d` generally improve error, so it is understandable you want to do so. If a high `max_d` value runs too slow, try setting `stepwise = 100` and `max_haplotypes` to a number that is close to 1000. This avoids searching the global minimizer of the least-squares problem for windows that have more than `max_haplotypes` number of unique haplotypes. Setting `thinning_factor` instead of `stepwise` have a similar effect. Details for these 2 heuristic searches are explained in the appendix of our paper. "

    "## Gotcha 3: You used memory swap\n",
    "\n",
    "While MendelImpute uses the least RAM compared to competing softwares (as of 2020), it is still possible for large imputation problems to consume all available RAM. If this happens, Julia will first try to use `swap` before crashing (until all of `swap` is consumed). Monitor your RAM usage constantly to make sure this doesn't happen. On Mac/Linux machines, the `top` or `htop` command will monitor this information. Alternatively, the `/usr/bin/time` command will automatically records max RAM usage for job and whether any `swap` had been performed. "
