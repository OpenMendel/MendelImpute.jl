You can calculate the number of typed SNPs per window by dividing the total number of SNPs in the target file by the total windows (a number that will be output after every run). Ideally you want an average of 400 typed SNPs per window, but something as low as 50 still works. Something like 10~20 is too low.

If a high max_d value runs too slow, try setting stepwise = 100 and max_haplotypes to a number that is close to 1000. This avoids searching the global minimizer of the least-squares problem for windows that have more than max_haplotypes number of unique haplotypes. Setting thinning_factor instead of stepwise have a similar effect. Details for these 2 heuristic searches are explained in the appendix of our paper.
